## 📜 Description
Ohm-s-Law-Experiment-Visualizer is a simple yet powerful tool for Class 11 students. This Python application helps you to demonstrate and verify Ohm’s Law, which states that Voltage (V) equals Current (I) multiplied by Resistance (R). Using this software, you can visualize how these electrical concepts work together in an interactive way.
