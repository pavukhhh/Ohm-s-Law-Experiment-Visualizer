## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates **Ohm’s Law** using a simple Python program.  
By entering a resistance value, the program calculates the current for voltages from **0V to 10V**, displays the data in a table, and plots a graph of **Current (I)** vs **Voltage (V)** — proving that they are directly proportional.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To verify **Ohm’s Law**, which states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided temperature remains constant.

\[
V = I \times R \quad \text{or} \quad I = \frac{V}{R}
\]

## 🧩 Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧮 **Automatic Calculation** | Calculates current for 0–10V at constant resistance |
| 📊 **Graph Visualization** | Plots I vs V graph using Matplotlib |
| 💡 **Educational Use** | Perfect for school lab reports or science exhibitions |
| 🧑‍💻 **Beginner Friendly** | Uses only basic Python concepts (loops, lists, math) |

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Matplotlib library  

Install the library (only once):

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
## ▶️ How to Run

- 1️⃣ Save the code as ohms_law.py
- 2️⃣ Open a terminal in the same folder
- 3️⃣ Run the script:
```
python ohms_law.py
```

- 4️⃣ Enter a resistance value (example: 5)
- 5️⃣ Observe the table and I–V graph

💻 Sample Output
```
=== Ohm's Law Experiment ===
This program calculates current for given voltage and resistance.

Enter resistance (in ohms): 5

Voltage (V)    Current (I)
0              0.00
1              0.20
2              0.40
3              0.60
...
10             2.00
```

### 📈 Graph:
Straight line graph between I and V verifying that I ∝ V.

### 🧾 Conclusion

From the observations and plotted graph,

The current (I) increases linearly with voltage (V) at constant resistance (R).
Hence, Ohm’s Law is verified.
